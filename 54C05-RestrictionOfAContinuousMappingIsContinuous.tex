{\bf Theorem} Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, and suppose
$f:X\to Y$ is a continuous function. For a subset $A\subset X$,
the \PMlinkname{restriction}{RestrictionOfAFunction} 
of $f$ to $A$ (that is $f|_A$) is a continuous
mapping $f|_A:A\to Y$, where $A$ is given the subspace topology
from $X$.

\emph{Proof.} We need to show that for any open set $V\subset Y$, we
can write $(f|_A)^{-1}(V) = A\cap U$ for some set $U$ that is open in $X$.
However, by the properties of the inverse image (see
\PMlinkname{this page}{InverseImage}), we have for any open set $V\subset Y$,
$$ (f|_A)^{-1}(V) = A\cap f^{-1}(V).$$
Since $f:X\to Y$ is continuous, $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$, and
our claim follows. $\Box$
